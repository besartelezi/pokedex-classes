# "Learning Classes" - Besart Elezi ft. The Pokédex
I have trouble understanding just exactly how classes work. Conceptually, I understand why we should use them and just how much easier it makes everything. But understanding what something is and how something works, are two different things.

I asked one of the coaches for help, and he told me that I should recreate the Pokédex from scratch, just use classes this time and add some other features to it. So that's exactly what I'm about to do.
